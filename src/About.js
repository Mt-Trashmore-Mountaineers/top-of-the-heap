                <h1>About the developers</h1>
                <h2>Jordan Lindo</h2>
                <p>Iâ€™m a software developer with experience on both large and small development teams building projects with different scopes and timelines. I obtained an Associates degree in software development from Kirkwood Community College, along with certificates in Java and .Net Programming. I rose as far as effort could take me in my position as an auditor. As a supervisor I led small teams and acted as the point of contact for clients. When my scrum team asked me to take over I became the leader of our scrum meetings. I facilitated interaction between scrum teams with a goal of efficient communication and effective results. When I encounter a complex problem I take time to think through a path that will reach the necessary conclusion.</p>

He has worked a wide variety of jobs, from retail sales to warehouse work to church ministry. He is now pursuing a career in software development as a student at Delta V.</p>
